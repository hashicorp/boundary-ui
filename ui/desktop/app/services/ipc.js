/**
 * An IPC request is a promise-like object that issues a request via
 * `window.postMessage` and resolves to a response received via a response
 * port.  IPC requests are used by an Electron renderer process to communicate
 * with the main process when the renderer is fully isolated.
 *
 * Some of the design goals of this "safe IPC" are to respect the confines
 * of process isolation and security, without using node integration, while
 * retaining the ability to run the Ember application within a browser
 * (sans main process) by using only APIs available in a standard
 * (non-Electron) browser.  This is achieved by posting messages to the
 * renderer's `window.postMessage` interface.  Thus, the renderer requires no
 * knowledge of the main process or the Electron context.  In fact a main
 * process and Electron context are not even required.
 *
 * In an Electron context, the `preload.js` script sets up a `window.postMessage`
 * listener which acts as proxy layer between the main and renderer processes.
 * It waits for incoming requests from the renderer and forwards them to main.
 * Responses from the main process are forwarded back via a response port
 * (sent with the original request).
 *
 * Local development in a non-Electron browser context or test context should
 * mock up IPC requests.  See the ipc service test for an example of mocking.
 *
 * TODO: add utilities for quickly mocking IPC responses (like Mirage)
 *
