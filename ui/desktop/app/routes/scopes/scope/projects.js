 * TODO:  This route is now vestigial.  Desktop does not provide project-based
 * navigation.  This route formerly provided a way to aggregate
 * all project scopes, which was necessary to then aggregate targets and
 * sessions under those projects.  Since the API now provides recursive listing,
 * it's possible to load all targets and sessions with a single call, no client-
 * side aggregation required.
 *
 * However, it _is_ necessary to prime the store with all project scopes.
 * This allows the UI to display project names on associated resources.
 *
 * The priming function of this route could be moved to scopes or scopes/scope.
 * It no longer makes sense as a dedicated route.
