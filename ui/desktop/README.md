## Running / Development

To run as web app:
* `yarn start`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

To run as a desktop app:
* `yarn start:desktop`

The Boundary CLI is downloaded and extracted to `electron-app/cli/` folder as part of
build. CLI version is defined in `electron-app/config/cli.js`.

### Developing Using Non-Release Versions of Boundary

You can also develop using a non-release version of Boundary - bypassing the
above CLI download behavior - by manually placing the version of Boundary that
you want to develop with in the `electron-app/cli/` directly (you may need to
create the directory).

After doing this, run yarn with `BYPASS_CLI_SETUP=true`; example: 
`BYPASS_CLI_SETUP=true yarn start:desktop`.

### Environment Variables

These environment variables may be used to customized the build.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `DEBUG_APP_UPDATER` | Enable to debug app updater feature. Must be enabled for all `APP_UPDATER_*` variables to be used. |
| `APP_UPDATER_CURRENT_VERSION` | Version of client. |
| `APP_UPDATER_LATEST_VERSION_TAG` | Next version for comparison with current version. |
| `APP_UPDATER_LATEST_VERSION_LOCATION` | Location of app release to use for updating client. Can be a filepath or url. |
| `BYPASS_CLI_SETUP` | Disable download and extraction of cli. For development use only. |
| `BYPASS_APP_UPDATER` | Disable app updater feature. For development use only. |
| `DISABLE_WINDOW_CHROME` | Disable window chrome. For internal use only. |
| `ENABLE_MIRAGE` | Enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) mirage. Default value is `true`. |

### Building for Production

Before executing a build, be sure to set any environment variables necessary
for your target [environment](#environment-variables). To build this UI for
production, run the following commands from this folder:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

`BOUNDARY_DESKTOP_SIGNING_IDENTITY` environment variable must be provided
to codesign MacOS artifacts in production.

The static production assets are saved into the `dist/` folder.
The Boundary CLI is downloaded and extracted to `electron-app/cli/` folder as part of
packaging. CLI version is defined in `electron-app/config/cli.js`.

Similar to running in development, you can also use `BYPASS_CLI_SETUP=true` to
bypass the download of the CLI, which can be useful for pre-release testing. See
[Developing Using Non-Release Versions of
Boundary](#developing-using-non-release-versions-of-boundary) for more details.

To build debian based linux artifacts on MacOS, additional [MacOS tools](https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/deb) need to be installed before running the following commands from this folder.

```
yarn install
yarn build:production # Build assets
yarn build:desktop:debianOnMacOS # Build app
```

#### Environment Variables

These environment variables may be used to customized the build.

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `APP_NAME` | Application Name | The user-facing name of the application, appearing in titles, etc. |
| `BOUNDARY_DESKTOP_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | | The name of the certificate to use when signing (e.g. Developer ID Application: * (*)). |
| `BYPASS_CLI_SETUP` | Set to `true` to launch without bootstrapping the CLI (see above). |

### Running Tests

* `yarn test` runs full tests in random order with coverage

Keep in mind that tests are executed in random order.  This is intentional
and helps to prevent hard-to-debug order dependencies among tests.

Please also note that we report test coverage.  We strive for "the right amount
of testing".  Use test coverage as a guide to help you identify untested
high-value code.

We rely on `ember-a11y-testing` to validate accessibility in acceptance tests.
If you write acceptance tests, please ensure at least one validation per
route using `await a11yAudit();`.

### Running end to end Tests

**The end-to-end test suite is supported for Mac, x64 and arm64 (M1) chips.**

*Be aware this is a temporary process that can suffer changes and eventually will be automated.*

This process will explain how to run end to end test in your local environment. The process will assume next:
- You already run the Boundary UI [installation process](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui#installation).
- You have Boundary installed, see [the installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/getting-started-install?in=boundary/getting-started).

Steps:
- Open a terminal and run `$ boundary dev`.
- Open another terminal and navigate to `$ boundary-ui/ui/desktop` folder.
- Run `$ yarn run e2e` and tests will start run.
- You can check the screenshots the tests take: `desktop/tests/end2end/screenshots`.

### Deploying

TBD

## Debug desktop client

There are two processes we can debug, `renderer` process and `main` process.

When I do need to debug the `main` process?

To debug code that is just executed in the main process, i.e to debug the `ipcMain` handler.

### Debug `renderer` process

To debug the renderer process, once the electron app is running, open the Chrome DevTools.

You can open the Chrome DevTools programmatically by calling the API on the `webContents` instance:

```javascript
const browserWindow = new BrowserWindow(browserWindowOptions);
browserWindow.webContents.openDevTools()
```

`browserWindow` reference in our code, [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/blob/main/ui/desktop/electron-app/src/index.js#L84).

### Debug `main` process 

To start the electron app with the inspector adding a breakpoint before code starts:

`$ yarn start:desktop --- --inspect-brk`.

To avoid the breakpoint:

`$ yarn start:desktop --- --inspect`.

You can use any of [these clients](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/#inspector-clients), but we will use the chrome inspector client. Open chrome and on the url bar: `$ chrome://inspect` and click inspect on the electron instance.

If you start the inspector with the `-brk` (breakpoint) code will not execute until you allow execution to continue (clicking the play button on the inspector).
