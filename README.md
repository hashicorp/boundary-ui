![Validate Monorepo](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/workflows/Validate%20Monorepo/badge.svg)

This monorepo contains multiple projects, including UIs and addons, used by
Boundary.

This top-level repository provides limited common tasks, such as installation
and commit assistance.  However, most tasks must be executed from within a
subproject, e.g. running or testing.

| test                | Runs tests in CI mode. |
| commit              | Replaces `git commit`, ensures compliance, audit, lint, and test checks pass before commit is allowed and normalizes commit messages across authors. |

## Contributing

### Branching

We follow [GitHub Flow][github-flow].

### Building ToC

To autogenerate a ToC (table of contents) for this README,
run `yarn doc:toc`.  Please update the ToC whenever editing the structure
of README.

### Building Admin UI for Production

See ui/admin/README.md Building for Production for more information on how to
build the Admin UI.  Be sure to set build-related environment variables as
necessary for your target environment, as described in the Admin UI readme.

To quickly produce a production build of Admin UI, run from this folder:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

Assets are saved to `ui/admin/dist/`.

#### Building with a Container

Optionally, you may build the UI within a container.  Execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-embedding.yml run build
```

Assets are saved to `ui/admin/dist/`.

### Committing

Instead of the default `git commit`, we prescribe a custom command that ensures
linting and other checks pass before a commit may be completed.  It also ensures
that all contributors author consistent commit messages.  To get started with a
commit, stage your files as usual.  Then run `yarn commit` and follow the
on-screen instructions to author your message.

#### License Checking

The licenses of dependencies are checking against an allowlist before every
commit.  This helps catch undesirable licenses sooner (e.g. GPL).  If your
commit fails due to a non-allowlisted license, you may add it to the allowlist
in `package.json` _as long as it is not a GPL variant or UNLICENSED_.
The change will be verified upon PR.  GPL variants and UNLICENSED dependencies
will not be accepted.
