<!-- Please reserve GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

For questions, the best place to get answers is on our [discussion forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/boundary), as they will get more visibility from experienced users than the issue tracker.

Please note: We take Boundary's security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Boundary, please responsibly disclose this by contacting us at security@hashicorp.com. Our PGP key is available on [our security page](https://www.hashicorp.com/security/).

Logging is available on Boundary Desktop Client version >= 2.1.0

Logs are found at:

Linux: ~/.config/Boundary/logs/desktop-client.log
MacOS: ~/Library/Logs/Boundary/desktop-client.log
Windows: $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Boundary\logs\desktop-client.log

If requests are taking longer than expected, please change the logging level to DEBUG. This will log the cache daemon request times as well.
