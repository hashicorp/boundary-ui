 * This session store is intended for use with Ember Simple Auth when requesting
 * that the server send cookies (see authenticators).
 *
 * The cookie session store is used to maintain session state for auth servers
 * that send cookies.  In this strategy, the server sets any cookies needed for
 * future authorization.  This store determines if a session is authenticated
 * by looking for the presence of a cookie with name specified in `cookieName`.
 *
 * This session store should not be used directly because it does not specify
 * `cookiePath` or `cookieName`.  To use, create an application session store
 * and extend this class, being sure to specify these attributes.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *   import CookieSessionStore from 'auth/session-stores/cookie';
 *   export default class ApplicationSessionStore extends CookieSessionStore {
 *     cookiePath = '/';
 *     cookieName = 'auth-token';
 *   }
