## Add core to an App

Add this addon to an Ember application's `devDependencies` as:
`"core": "*"`, for applications included in this monorepo.

## Installation

See monorepo README for installation instructions.

## I18n

To access translations within a template, see `ember-intl` docs.

## Notifications

Use notificaiton decorators to notify the user when a function or action
succeeds or fails.  For example:

```js
import { notifySuccess, notifyError } from 'core/decorators/notify';

export default class ExampleRoute extends Route {
  @notifyError(({ message }) => message, { catch: true })
  @notifySuccess('notifications.delete-success')
  async myAction() {
    // do something
  }
}
```

## Confirmations

This addon exposes a service to request confirmations and the component
used to expose them to users.  A decorator is exposed for convenience.

To guard an action on a confirmation, decorate it with `@confirm`. In this
example, the confirmation looks up the translation under a
`questions.delete-confirm` key.

```js
import { confirm } from 'core/decorators/confirm';

export default class ExampleRoute extends Route {
  @confirm('questions.delete-confirm')
  async myAction() {
    // do something
  }
}
```

In the application template, iterate over confirmations, yielding the
confirmation instance as well as accept and deny functions which, when called,
update the confirmation status.

```html
<PendingConfirmations as |confirmation accept deny|>
  {{!-- your confirmation dialog component here --}}
</PendingConfirmations
```

## App and Company Names

To make use of the `app-name`, `company-name`, and `company-copyright` helpers,
add `appName` an `companyName` keys to your Ember config
(see admin for example).

## Documentation URLs

To render doc links in your application, be sure to configure the links in your
Ember config (see admin).  Then reference doc links by keys:

```html
<DocLink @doc="account" @iconSize="large" />
```

## Loading Helper

See admin and desktop routes and templates for examples of how to
use the loading subsystem.  For example, to annotate that an async action should
present a loading indicator to a user:

```js
@action
@loading
async myAction() {
  // ...do potentially time-consuming task
}
```

## Scope Service

This addon exposes a service to hold all active scopes (org and project where available).

To make use of the service, import it and initialize it using service injection.

```js
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class ExampleRoute extends Route {
  @service scope;
  async myAction() {
    // do something
  }
}
```
